This subtype of red-green color blindness is found in about 6% of the male population, mostly in its mild form deuteranomaly. When you have a look at the color spectrum of a deuteranopic person you can see that a variety of colors look different than in a normal color spectrum. Whereas red and green are the main problem colors, there are also for example some gray, purple and a greenish blue-green which canâ€™t be distinguished very well.",

This subtype of red-green color blindness is found in about 6% of the male population, mostly in its mild form deuteranomaly. Anomalous Trichromats: Deuteranomaly (green-weak). This can be everything between almost normal color vision and deuteranopia. The green sensitive cones are not missing in this case, but the peak of sensitivity is moved towards the red sensitive cones.",
