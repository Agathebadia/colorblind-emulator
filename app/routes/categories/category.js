This subtype of red-green color blindness is found in about 6% of the male population, mostly in its mild form deuteranomaly. When you have a look at the color spectrum of a deuteranopic person you can see that a variety of colors look different than in a normal color spectrum. Whereas red and green are the main problem colors, there are also for example some gray, purple and a greenish blue-green which canâ€™t be distinguished very well.",
